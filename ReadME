Terraform Project: Deploying S3 Bucket with CloudFront Distribution
This project uses Terraform to deploy an S3 bucket configured as a static website and a CloudFront distribution to serve the content globally.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Terraform (version 5.55.0)
AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Configure Terraform Variables:

Update the variables in variables.tf or create a terraform.tfvars file to set your AWS region, bucket name, domain name, etc.

Review and Apply Terraform Plan:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
This will show you the execution plan and then apply it to create your resources on AWS.

Access Your Website:

After Terraform applies the changes, you can access your website using the CloudFront domain name or custom domain configured.

Project Structure
main.tf: Defines the main infrastructure components (S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution).
variables.tf: Declares input variables used in main.tf.
outputs.tf: Defines the outputs (e.g., CloudFront domain name) that are useful after deployment.
modules/cloudfront/: Contains the CloudFront module configuration (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf).
Additional Configuration
Custom Domain: Update CloudFront distribution and Route 53 configuration in main.tf and modules/cloudfront/main.tf for custom domain setup.
SSL/TLS: Modify CloudFront distribution to use custom SSL/TLS certificates if required.
